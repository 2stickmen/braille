A Python module that supports conversion between text, image, speech, and braille for developers.

#### Inspiration
In the world, 36 million people are blind, and I wanted to create a project that would make blind people's life easier. I was searching for a Python library to assist braille technology, but I found nothing. So, I decided to create my own library to assist developers create projects that integrates braille technology.

#### What it does
With this library, developers can simply install and import this library and perform conversions between text, image, speech, and braille.

#### What I learned
Through the process of making this project, I learned a lot about creating a library in Python. Specifically, I used built-in libaries, arrays, and dictionaries that helped me create my own library.
